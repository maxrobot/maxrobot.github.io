# Introduction
The succintly titled _"The Spider Network: The Wild Story of a Math Genius, a Gang of Backstabbing Bankers, and One of the Greatest Scams in Financial History"_ follows the case of trader Tom Hayes as he goes from zero to hero and back again after becoming embroiled in the libor scandal.

David Enrich does his best Michael Lewis, a compliment, and paints a vivid though somewhat detail orientated picture of the wild west of pre-2008 finance. What emerges is slightly upsetting portrait of a man who unwittingly becomes the scapegoat for a problem much larger than any individual.

## Why Is It Interesting?
The Libor, pronounced "lie-bore", rate rigging scandal erupted in the post financial crash and further tarnished the excellent reputation of the world's largest financial institutions. Libor is defined as,

_"The rate at which an individual Contributor Panel bank could borrow funds, were it to do so by asking for and then accepting inter-bank offers in reasonable market size, just prior to 11.00 London time"_

which in more broad terms translates to an interest rate designed to measure the cost of borrowing money for banks - [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libor). By the time the book gets going, shortly prior to the financial crisis, the Libor rate had become part of almost every esoteric financial instrument and asset - indeed banks even started indexing mortgages to various Libor rates. This would have potentially been fine if it wasn't the banks themselves setting the rates. Eventually traders realised that they could move Libor to suit their portfolios by submitting whatever they wanted and from time to time roping a former colleague into doing the same at other institutions. 

So the most important rate in the financial market infrastructure turns out to be subject to the whims of individuals who express interest is that the rate move higher or lower! Despite this not really being against the rules it wasn't really the point and undermined the Libor rates credibility.

Slowly more people became aware of the issue queue an investigation, botched cover up and trial. Ending with a sole person in prison...


## What Can We Take Away?
David Enrich describes the ascendancy of the young trader Tom Hayes, showing the reader a neurotic young professional who stumbles into a world where his talents are highly valued but anything other than his ability to make money is not nurtured. In this way the story is almost a modern fairy tale. Haye's unwittingly loses his innocence in a Faustian bargain with the modern investment banker devil. A cautionary tale as to the pitfalls of being too greedy, too arrogant and not having enough friends.

Hayes rise to prominence comes fast and though he has a number of potential career setbacks, leaving RBC with some clouds hanging around his work there, he ends up a young rich star trader for UBS in Tokyo with the world at his feet. Throughout his career he develops a network of brokers and fellow traders with whom he attempts to push Libor in whatever direction he needs it to go that day. Hayes and his network become so envied that he is continually hunted by rival banks and finally lands the big payoff with Citi receiving a seven figure signing bonus, it all seems too good to be true - which it then rapidly is.

The prop trading giant falls hard and Hayes is suddenly left on the outside with nothing but his signing bonus and a court case. Justice is served... However throughout the book Hayes is an often isolated figure within each company he works for despite being extremely valuable. Not being able to maintain friendships with his closest colleagues and making enemies with his rivals. Indeed even as the house is burning down Hayes never seems to be able to act in his own best interest almost insistently work against people trying to help him and with those working against him.

What is clear throughout the book that if Hayes, and many around him, had been able to look at what he was doing from the distance it should have been obvious that they were skirting the edges of "moral" behaviour.

## Conclusion
An exciting insight into what even the most normal people become when their only incentive or measure of success in their job is the pure pursuit of profit. However it is also a story of an individual who gets caught in a situation much larger than themselves and it seems unfair that Hayes ends up with an 11 year sentence. Though Tom Hayes seems not to have given up the fight and believes he was [framed](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/i-was-framed-by-ubs-tom-hayes-letters-from-prison-20180604)!
