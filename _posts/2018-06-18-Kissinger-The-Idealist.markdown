# Introduction
As one the most polemic figures of the 20th century Henry Kissinger has definitely led a life worth reading about. Kissinger's influence in shaping American foreign policy and thus world politics has been felt from the early 50's to the present day.

Niall Ferguson's first volume of Kissinger's biography takes us from his early life in Nazi Germany right up to when he becomes Secretary of State in the Nixon administration. We are shown the formation of the man while Ferguson attempts to shed, or at least counter, the criticisms that Hitchens and others have laid at the feet of Kissinger.

## Why Is It Interesting?
In many ways Kissinger was in government during the most difficult, but interesting, moments of the 20th century - the Nixon administration!

Nixon was an extremely polarising President, and there are many parallels between his time in office and the present day - June 2018. Indeed Nixon's time in office saw great upheaval in the global order, the collapse of Bretton Woods, end of the Vietnam war, and the return of China. Not to mention the scandals which weighed the Nixon administration down.

Due to the distraction of Watergate Kissinger managed to make many key decisions with, perhaps, not as much oversight as was typically afforded to Secretary's of State.

Hence understanding the _bildung_ of the man who made these decisions and getting to know him is key to the comprehension of American policy from 1968 onwards but also the world we live in today.

## What Can We Take Away?
Ferguson shows Kissinger's approach political science to come via historiography and reading any of Kissinger's own work will quickly confirm this. In actual fact Kissinger is obsessed with the follies of 19th century Europe, after completing his Doctorate title "Peace, Legitimacy, and the Equilibrium (A Study of the Statesmanship of Castlereagh and Metternich)" he seems to spend the rest of his life quoting from this period with the occasional reference to the Greeks and Romans.

The constant referring to the most tangible history seems to be Kissinger's way of seeing clearly through the decisions he is making and to give him a compass in the chaos of the moment. Far from the image of the Machiavellian bureaucrat Kissinger shows a innate understanding of the problems of democracy when in 1954 he writes to colleague Arthur Schlesinger regarding _McCarthyism_,

  _"It is the essence of a democratic system that the loser can accept his defeat with relative grace. It is the essence of a totalitarian system that the victor assumes the right to proscribe his opponents... When the risks of electoral defeat are so fearful, campaigns will be fought with a bitterness which must erode the democratic process. When the issue becomes juridical instead of political, political contests take on the characteristics of a civil war..."_

here Kissinger is worrying about the polarisation of political opinion in the 50's and despite the slightly more ideological nature of the Cold War his comments seem as true then as now.

Later Kissinger discusses the problems that lead to the decline of nations stating,

  _'The collapse of nations is due to the internal rigidity coupled with a decline in the ability, both moral and physical to shape the surrounding circumstances...'_

this insight into what makes a nation tick is another display of Kissinger's ingenious at understanding the true nature of our political society. In fact the seeming current decline of Great Britain could be explained through the inability of the May government come to any decision whatsoever with regards to leaving the European Union.

Perhaps more pertinent to the current crisis of _centrism_ were Kissingers 1963 comments about the Cuban missile crisis,

  _"The pragmatists who pride themselves so very much on their flexibility, and who always say that they're steering the precise middle course between extremes, and who say that if two sides take a position they have both to be wrong, and the fellow in the middle must be right - this exaltation of the middle ground is bound to produce the extremes which everybody deplores, because when you are dealing with the perfect pragmatist the only way you can get what you want is to produce the kinds of pressures which will force him to adjust, and everybody has the highest degree of incentive to create pressures.... The very flexible people, the very 'pragmatic' people, are really as international phenomena absolutely unreliable people, because one cannot be sure what they're going to do until one knows what the situation is._

again it is the shift of the Overton window by "extremists" that Kissinger brilliantly sees long before it had become as pressing an issue as it seems to be currently. This is the core feeling that I get about Kissinger when reading his biography, that he just _gets_ the world of geopolitics and has a keen eye for human behaviour. Though we also see that Kissinger is not always at ease with the _in-person_ aspects of politics. Notably Kissinger's remarks during the 1968 Nelson Rockefeller campaign that _'there are probably better people to run the campaign than myself'_ showing his awareness of his own limitations.

## Conclusion
In this first volume Niall Ferguson really gets to the core of Kissinger as a person _before_ he was the much famed international man of mystery running the State Department during the day and flouncing with the rich and famous at night. Contrary to the oft held opinion of Kissinger's _evil_ he comes across as a man deeply shaped by the experience of his childhood, always understanding the shadows of human nature. Kissinger seemed to grasp early the need for the United States to win hearts and minds and not military battles, and his private correspondence shows him to almost exclusively to be on the right side of history. The book leaves you wanting the second volume and to understand why despite his best intentions his time in office did not go down, in the history books at least, as the pinnacle of American democracy.
